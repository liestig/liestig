## 🧑‍💻❔ Who am I

Hi! I'm **Liès**, a **25-year-old software engineer** based in **France**. I love tackling complex problems, exploring
innovative solutions, and contributing to research-driven projects.

## 🐠📱 Fishbotica

I'm also part of an amazing project called [**Fishbotica**](https://fishbotica.com/). We're on a mission to make **aquarium keeping** accessible to both beginners and experts.  
The project is still in its early stages, but is incubated at [**Nausicaá**](https://www.nausicaa.fr/en/committed-center/blue-living-lab) and actively
followed by them. Join us on social media to be part of the adventure!
